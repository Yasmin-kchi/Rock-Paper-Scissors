In this version of RPS, you will be competing against the computer. 
You can choose between rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer will randomly make its choice as well. The outcomes are simple:

-Rock crushes Scissors
-Paper covers Rock
-Scissors cut Paper

If both you and the computer choose the same item, it's a tie and you'll have to play again.
